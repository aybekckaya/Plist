# Plist

Plist is an asynchronous property list manager that is written in Swift.  Main features includes: 
* Creating property list 
* Copying any property list from appâ€™s bundle to documents directory
* Save any data with key asynchronously 
* Read any data as dictionary asynchronously
* Listing all plist files in documents directory 


## Getting Started

Download the project and copy the PlistSwift folder into your project and then simply you can use it in any file




``` swift
  // creating plist at /documentsFolder/plistPath/myPlist.plist
        let list = Plist(_name: "myList", _source: .documentsDirectory, _folderPath: "plistPath")
        
        //copy list from bundle to documents folder
        let listAtBundle = Plist(_name: "myListAtBundle", _source: .bundle, _folderPath: "plistPath")
        
        // save data to plist
        let data:[String:Any] = ["name" : "forest" , "surname":"gump" , "id":132]
        list.save(key: "myKey", data: data) { error in
            print("error : \(error)")
        }
        
        // read data from list
        list.read(key: "myKey") { (data, error) in
            guard error == nil else {
                print("error : \(error)")
                return
            }
        }
        
        // remove value with key
        list.removeKey(key: "myKey")
        
        //remove Plist from documents directory
        list.removePlist()
        
        //all plists' names from given folder at documents directory
        let allLists = Plist.allPlistFiles(directoryName: "plistPath")

```
